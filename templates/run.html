  <p>The focus of this project is about automate classification
    of dataset using clustering algorithms. The project is separated
    in four parts: 1. preprocessing the data, 2. clustering, 3. classification and 4. create antologies.
    Clustering is about create subset of the data set, adopting similarity criteria.
    Classification is about to know what is the relationship between the elements of each subset.
    Create antologies is the way to mine information about the hole dataset through data analyzes.

  <h2>1. The datasets</h2>

  <p>Four types of dataset were chosen form kaggle witch mean that is accessible to everyone who wants to replicate for didactic purposes. First of them, the <a href="https://gist.github.com/tijptjik/9408623">wine</a> dataset was chosen which was preprocessed.
